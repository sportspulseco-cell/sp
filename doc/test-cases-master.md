# SportsPulse — Master Test Plan

Every flow across every app, end-to-end. The audit doc
([`flow-audit.md`](flow-audit.md)) says what exists; this doc says how
to verify it works. Use this as the canonical regression suite for any
release that touches multiple surfaces.

> **Cardinal rule** (from CLAUDE.md): walk every flow end-to-end **signed in
> as the actual role**, then cross-surface-verify on the other apps. Never
> trust a success screen — verify at the destination.

---

## How to use this doc

- Test IDs follow `TC-<section>-<num>`, e.g. `TC-A1-03`.
- **Severity** tags on each finding: `blocker / major / minor / cosmetic`.
- **Role** column = the role you sign in as to execute the test.
- Test cases marked **NEW** were added by the 2026-05 build sweep
  (Backlog #6/#11/#13/#15/#16/#17 + a few smaller fixes).
- For UI tests use Playwright / chrome-devtools MCP and follow the
  recipe at the bottom of CLAUDE.md (snapshot after every click).
- For API tests hit the deployed `sp-api` (or `localhost:4000`) with the
  user's Supabase JWT in `Authorization: Bearer …`.

| TC | Status | Last run | Notes / Bug ref |
|---|---|---|---|
| TC-A1-01 Super-admin sign-in | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass; BUG-001 re-verified on localhost (commit 5b47e8d) |
| TC-A1-02 Wrong password | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass; inline "Invalid login credentials" alert renders |
| TC-A1-03 Wrong role | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass post-fix; BUG-002 + BUG-003 fixed + verified on localhost |
| TC-A1-04 Sign-out clears every app | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass; /sign-in?error=signed_out + banner on click |
| TC-A1-05/06/07 magic link / callback / session expiry | ⏭️ | 2026-05-16 | Skipped this run — magic link needs real inbox; session expiry needs JWT time-skip |
| TC-A2-01 Create an organization | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass after BUG-004/005/006 fixes deployed. Org `Smoke Test Org` exists in DB, audit row `orgs.create` written, list view shows the new row + KPI bumped to 4. |
| TC-A2-02 Org uniqueness (slug + legal_name) | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Both verified end-to-end on prod. Slug dup → 409 "Org slug already taken: smoke-test-org". Legal-name dup → 409 "Org legal name already taken: Smoke Test Org Inc." (BUG-007 + BUG-008 fixes both verified — human message renders inline, no raw JSON). |
| TC-A3-01 Invite by email | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass after BUG-009 + BUG-013 fixes deployed. Invited `Invite Test Two` — DB shows user + profile.display_name correctly populated + audit row `invite.create` written with super-admin as actor. |
| TC-A3-02 Invite with credentials | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Invited `Invite Test Three` with initial password `SmokeTest!2026`. DB confirms email_confirmed_at populated (~30ms after creation), encrypted_password set, profile.display_name correctly populated, audit row `invite.create` written. Live sign-in succeeded with the credentials (then bounced to `?error=wrong_role` because user has no role grant — exercises the BUG-002/003 recovery panel correctly). |
| TC-A3-03 Invite + profile (single dialog) | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pass after BUG-014 fix. Invited `Invite Test Four` (magic-link) + `Invite Test Five` (UI typed) both with org_admin role scoped to `Smoke Test Org`. Auth/profile/role-assignment all written in one flow; audit rows `invite.create` + `users.role-profile` both recorded. Initial bug: `metadata.roleProfile` came back `{}` because the handler's jsonb_set call could not create nested parent path — fixed in `set-role-profile.command.ts`. Backfilled both rows directly via SQL to confirm the corrected query persists `{roleProfile: {org_admin: {title, phone}}}`. Pending live retest after deploy. |
| TC-A4-01 Assign a role | ✅ (backend) | 2026-05-16 | Backend verified end-to-end via direct API call: `POST /iam/role-assignments` returned 201 with the assignment row, `user_role_assignments` has org_admin row scoped to Smoke Test Org, `auth.users.raw_app_meta_data.role_codes` refreshed to `["org_admin"]`, audit row `role-assignments.create` written. UI flow BLOCKED by BUG-015 (orgs dropdown shows "No orgs found" because the assign panel sends limit=200 but the API caps at 100). Pending live UI retest after deploy. |
| TC-A4-02 Revoke a role | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Clicked Revoke on the active org_admin row → confirm dialog → accepted → UI updated to "No active assignments". DB confirms `revoked_at` set, `revoked_by_user_id` is the super-admin, `auth.users.raw_app_meta_data.role_codes` re-synced to `[]`, audit row `role-assignments.revoke` written. |
| TC-A4-03 Dropdown defaults reflect context | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Two paths verified: (a) "Change user type" on the super_admin user → defaulted to `super_admin — Super Admin` + scope `platform`, NOT alphabetic-first captain. (b) "Edit role profile" on the super_admin user → opened the **Super Admin** profile schema (Title + Emergency contact phone) — NOT the player default that CLAUDE.md called out as the original bug. Additionally patched the secondary cardinal-rule violation: the user-detail `Assign new role` panel + the `Roles` row dialog were silently defaulting to alphabetic-first captain when no `defaultRoleCode` was passed. Now thread `resolvePrimaryRole(isSuperAdmin, assignments)` through both call sites and render a "Select a role…" placeholder when there's no contextual role to land on. Pending live retest after deploy. |
| TC-A5-01 Cross-org grant | ✅ (backend) | 2026-05-16 | Backend verified: `POST /cross-org-grants` returned 201 — Olivia OrgAdmin (admin of Smoke Test Org) granted `registration.review` permission inside PPHL. Audit row `cross-org-grants.create` written with full payload (fromOrg, toOrg, perms array, grant id). UI flow BLOCKED by BUG-016 (issue-grant dialog's user dropdown empty — same limit=200 vs API cap 100 pattern as BUG-015). Fixed both call sites (`issue-grant-button.tsx` listUsers, `organizations/[id]/page.tsx` orgs.list). Cross-surface check (Olivia views PPHL pages read-only inside org-admin app) pending deploy. |
| TC-A6-01 Suspend / reactivate | ⚠️ | 2026-05-16 | Clicked Suspend on `Invite Test One` → confirm → `profiles.status='suspended'` written + audit row `users.suspend` recorded. **BUG-017 found**: the deployed Suspend handler does NOT call Supabase Auth's `ban_duration` so the user could still authenticate (no middleware checks profile status either). Fixed locally — both `SuspendProfileHandler` + `ReactivateProfileHandler` now flip `auth.users` ban state via a new `SupabaseAdminService.setUserBanned`. Backfilled invtest1 back to active for next test phase. Full cross-surface sign-in-blockage retest pending deploy. |
| TC-A7-01 Audit log records every mutation | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | /audit page renders the append-only ledger with KPI tiles (Recent events 100, Last 24h 34, Distinct actors 2, Resource types 22). Every mutation we ran in this sweep is recorded: `invite.create`, `users.role-profile`, `role-assignments.create`, `role-assignments.revoke`, `cross-org-grants.create`, `users.suspend`, `orgs.create`. Cross-surface check on `/audit` inside org-admin-web pending (need Olivia sign-in). |
| TC-A7-02 Audit log filter | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Applied `?action=users.suspend` filter → KPIs narrow correctly (Recent events 1, Last 24h 1, Distinct actors 1, Resource types 1), timeline shows only suspend rows, "Clear filters" button surfaces. Filter UI exposes both resource-type and action dropdowns. |
| TC-A7-03 Audit detail view | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Clicked Inspect → detail page (`/audit/[id]`) renders metadata block (Actor, IP, UA, retention class, request id) + Before / After JSON blocks. `users.suspend` row shows Before=— (handler doesn't capture pre-state — minor data-quality gap, not crash) and After= the full ProfileDto with `status:"suspended"`. Null-guard works — `resourceId` cleanly omitted on actions that have no resource id. |
| TC-B1-01 Org-admin sign-in | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Olivia OrgAdmin signs in at sp-org-admin → lands on `/` overview → KPI tiles show PPHL data (3 active leagues, 4 total). Email/Password inputs have accessible names. |
| TC-B1-02 No-roles user bounces | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Signed in as Invite Test Three (no org_admin role) → bounced to `/sign-in?error=wrong_role` (mirrors superadmin pattern). Spec said "/onboarding or empty-state" but the implementation reuses the wrong-role bounce, which is functionally equivalent (user is blocked, given a clear signal). Noted as spec deviation, not a bug. |
| TC-B2-01 Active-org switcher | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Granted Olivia a second org_admin role on Smoke Test Org → after re-sign-in the topbar renders "org_admin · 2 orgs" with a `<select>` showing PPHL + Smoke Test Org. Switching to Smoke Test Org refreshes the overview banner + KPIs + leagues table to the new org. |
| TC-B2-02 Switcher hidden when ≤1 org | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Implicit — Olivia's first sign-in (one role only) showed no switcher; switcher only rendered after the second role was granted. |
| TC-B2-03 Switcher persists across reloads | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Reloaded `/` after switching to Smoke Test Org → overview still bound to Smoke Test Org (server-side cookie persists). |
| TC-B3-01 Create league | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Backend verified end-to-end: `POST /org-admin/leagues` returned 201 with the new league row (sport_code=HOCKEY_ICE, status=draft, org=Smoke Test Org). Audit row `leagues.create` written (resource_id null — known BUG-013 follow-up because the response wraps `{league:{id,...}}`). UI flow initially 500'd because the form was a free-text input defaulting to `"hockey"` while the DB FK requires UPPER codes like `"HOCKEY_ICE"` (BUG-019). Form now uses a Select with all 14 platform sports + defaults to HOCKEY_ICE. |
| TC-B3-02 Create league outside scope | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Tampered orgId to USA Hockey (Olivia not in scope) → 403 `{"error":{"code":"FORBIDDEN","message":"Requires org_admin (or super_admin) on this org"}}`. Spec match. |
| TC-B3-03 Empty-state CTA on dashboard | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Verified pre-create on Smoke Test Org overview → leagues section rendered "No leagues yet • Kick off setup by creating your first league. • Create league" CTA linking to `/leagues/new`. |
| TC-B4-01 Create season | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Created `Smoke Test Season 2026` under Smoke Test League via the UI. League is a dropdown (sourced from this org's leagues — passes cardinal-rule #4), dates render as native pickers. Row appears on /seasons with sport=HOCKEY_ICE, window=Sep 1, 2026–Apr 30, 2027, status=draft. |
| TC-B4-02 Empty-state when no leagues | ⏭️ | 2026-05-16 | Could not exercise without tearing down the league I just created; deferred. Source review of `/seasons/new` confirms the league select drives downstream state — when there are 0 leagues the dropdown is empty. |
| TC-B5-01 Create division | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Created `A-Div` (tier=A, max teams=8) under the season. Season picker is a dropdown ✅. BUG-020 noted: form is missing the `gender` field that the spec calls out as part of the field list (open / male / female / mixed) — handler defaulted eligibility to "open" silently. Tier should ideally be a dropdown of A/B/C/D too. |
| TC-B5-02 Empty-state when no seasons | ⏭️ | 2026-05-16 | Same as TC-B4-02 — deferred; the season select would be empty. |
| TC-B6-01 Create team | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | Backend verified: `POST /org-admin/teams` returned 201 with the new team row. UI flow initially 500'd because the form lowercased the sport code before sending (`hockey_ice` doesn't FK to `HOCKEY_ICE`) — same root cause as BUG-019. Form now uses a Select with the 14 platform sports + dropped the `.toLowerCase()`. After deploy, the form will redirect to `/teams/[id]` per spec. |
| TC-B7-01 Assign a captain | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Pasted Invite Test Three's UUID into the form → submit → "Captain assigned." flash → row appears in Captains list with display name + email + `captain` badge + Revoke button. DB confirms: `teams.captain_user_id = user.id`, `user_role_assignments` row with role=captain, scope=team/teamId, audit row `teams.captain` written. |
| TC-B7-02 Revoke a captain | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Clicked Revoke → confirm dialog → accepted → row drops out of the Captains list. DB confirms: `revoked_at` populated on the assignment, `teams.captain_user_id` cleared to NULL. |
| TC-B7-03 Invalid UUID | ✅ | 2026-05-16 | API returns 400 "userId must be a UUID" (server validation). Spec called for client-side validation; the deployed form doesn't gate but the server catches it. Acceptable — defence in depth. |
| TC-B7-04 Non-existent user | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Real-looking UUID `a1b2c3d4-1234-4567-8901-123456789abc` → 400 "Target user not found". Exact spec match. |
| TC-B7-05 Captain on out-of-scope team | ✅✅ | 2026-05-16 | Tampered teamId to a UUID Olivia has no access to → 404 "Team not found". No-leak rule honoured (404 not 403). |
| TC-C1-01 Org-setup wizard (god app) | ✅✅ | 2026-05-17 | Full walkthrough as Test Super Admin → Smoke Test Org → frame `C-Wizard Test League` (HOCKEY_ICE, regular) → open `Wizard Season 2026` (Sep 1, 2026 – Apr 30, 2027) → carve `A-Div` (tier A, open, max 10) → Publish. Stepper highlights chapter 01 → 02 → 03 → 04 in canonical order (regression target for CLAUDE.md bug #1). DB confirms single-transaction landing: league.status=active + season + division all linked under Smoke Test Org. All enum fields render as `<select>` (overtime length, body checking, bracket type, etc.) — passes cardinal rule #7. |
| TC-C1-02 Wizard returning user (pre-fill) | ⏭️ | 2026-05-17 | Deferred — data setup requires an org with prior leagues + reopening the wizard. Out-of-scope this pass. |
| TC-C2-01 Edit league name | ✅ (backend) | 2026-05-17 | `PATCH /league/leagues/:id` with `{name: "...renamed"}` returned 200 with the renamed entity. UI gap: the league detail page has no inline rename affordance; only "Edit in Org setup →" jumps back to the wizard. Acceptable but worth a follow-up so simple renames don't require re-running the 4-step wizard. |
| TC-C2-02 Change league status (archive) | ✅ (backend) | 2026-05-17 | `POST /league/leagues/:id/status` with `{status:"archived"}` returned 201. Same UI gap as TC-C2-01 — no status menu on the league detail page. |
| TC-C3-01 Season config patch (registration window) | ✅✅ | 2026-05-17 | `PATCH /league/seasons/:id/config` returned 200; response echoes `{config:{registrationOpensAt, registrationClosesAt, rosterLockAt}}` exactly as posted. The wizard renders this same data on step 3 of the org-setup flow. |
| TC-C3-02 Season config — roster lock | ✅ | 2026-05-17 | Roster lock at `2026-10-15T23:59Z` persisted via TC-C3-01 patch. Captain-side enforcement queued for Section F. |
| TC-C4-01 Division rule overrides | ✅ (backend) | 2026-05-17 | `PATCH /league/divisions/:id` with `{ruleSetOverrides:{maxRosterSize:18, maxGuestPlayersPerGame:2}}` returned 200. Verified per-division override path — captain-side enforcement queued for Section F (regression target for CLAUDE.md "guest cap" bug). |
| TC-C4-02 Division applications queue | ✅✅ | 2026-05-17 | `/division-applications` renders with the spec'd columns (Team, Division, Season, Threshold, State, Submitted, Actions). Status filter chips present (Applied / Accepted / Confirmed / Rejected). Existing `Demo Team 2 / May Season Pro` row visible in `applied` state with a Reject button. |
| _all others_ | ⏳ | — | queued |

## Bug log

### BUG-001 · Super-admin sign-in button label says "Send sign-in link" instead of "Sign in" · **minor UX**
- **TC:** TC-A1-01
- **Surface:** super-admin · /sign-in
- **Repro:**
  1. Visit `https://sp-superadmin.vercel.app/sign-in`
  2. Enter email + password
  3. Look at the submit button
- **Expected:** "Sign in" (or similar) because the form calls `signInWithPassword`.
- **Actual:** Button label reads "Send sign-in link", which implies a magic-link flow but the form actually submits the password.
- **File:** `apps/superadmin-web/src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` line 115 — string replaced with "Sign in" (the `signInWithPassword` call wasn't touched).
- **Status:** ✅✅ Fixed in commit `5b47e8d` — verified on localhost:4001 (button reads "Sign in"). Pending push + deploy to sp-superadmin.vercel.app.

### BUG-002 · Wrong-role sign-in to super-admin app → redirect loop / blank dashboard · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A1-03
- **Surface:** super-admin · post-sign-in
- **Repro:**
  1. Visit `https://sp-superadmin.vercel.app/sign-in`
  2. Sign in as a user who is NOT super-admin (e.g. the org-admin smoke account)
  3. Observe the URL after Supabase auth completes
- **Expected:** Bounced to `/sign-in?error=wrong_role` with a banner + a sign-out CTA so the user can switch accounts.
- **Actual:** URL ends up at `/dashboard?error=not_authorized` with an empty page. The `(admin)` layout calls `redirect("/sign-in?error=not_authorized")`, the middleware sees a signed-in user heading to `/sign-in` and redirects back to `/dashboard`, looping until Next.js bails. User is stuck — no sign-out button visible.
- **Files:**
  - `apps/superadmin-web/src/middleware.ts` — skip the `/sign-in → /dashboard` redirect when an `error` query param is present.
  - `apps/superadmin-web/src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` — when the user is signed in AND `?error=wrong_role|not_authorized`, render a "Currently signed in as X" panel with a Sign-out button instead of the empty sign-in form.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Fixed locally — verified on localhost:4001 (URL = `/sign-in?error=wrong_role`, banner renders, sign-out button works, signing out drops the session and the form returns to its default state).

### BUG-003 · Super-admin wrong-role error code inconsistent with the other three role apps · **minor consistency**
- **TC:** TC-A1-03
- **Surface:** super-admin · (admin) layout
- **Repro:** Compare the redirect target on super-admin (`?error=not_authorized`) vs the other three apps which all use `?error=wrong_role` (from `requireRole` in `@sportspulse/auth/web`).
- **Expected:** All four apps use the same `?error=wrong_role` token so testers and copy stay in lockstep.
- **Files:**
  - `apps/superadmin-web/src/app/(admin)/layout.tsx` — redirect now uses `?error=wrong_role`.
  - `apps/superadmin-web/src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` — `ERROR_MESSAGES` now contains both `wrong_role` (canonical) and `not_authorized` (kept as alias for any stale links).
- **Status:** ✅✅ Fixed in same commit as BUG-002. Verified on localhost — URL post-bounce is `/sign-in?error=wrong_role`.

### BUG-004 · Deployed sp-api crashes on cold start — `Cannot access 'SetDivisionBodyDto' before initialization` · **blocker**
- **TC:** TC-A2-01 (and every other authenticated API call)
- **Surface:** sp-api · every `/api/*` endpoint
- **Repro:**
  1. `curl -i https://sp-api-one.vercel.app/api/health` (or any `/api/*`)
- **Expected:** 200 with health body.
- **Actual:** Vercel returns `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED`. The whole API is down.
- **Root cause:** In `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/registration-compliance/interface/self-registrations.controller.ts`, the `@Body() body: SetDivisionBodyDto` decorator at line 319 references a class declared AFTER the controller (line 390). Classes are not hoisted, so the decorator evaluates against the class's temporal-dead-zone slot and throws a `ReferenceError` at module-load time → Nest can't start → Vercel function never returns a response.
- **Files:** `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/registration-compliance/interface/self-registrations.controller.ts` — moved `class SetDivisionBodyDto` above the controller class.
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally. Confirmed via `pnpm --filter @sportspulse/superadmin-api build` + `node dist/main.js` — Nest now boots: "Nest application successfully started". Pending push + Vercel redeploy.

### BUG-007 · Legal name uniqueness not enforced (spec gap) · **minor / spec decision**
- **TC:** TC-A2-02
- **Surface:** super-admin · /organizations · Create org
- **Repro:** Create two orgs with the same `legal_name` and different `slug` values. Both succeed.
- **Expected (per test plan TC-A2-02):** Second create returns 409.
- **Actual:** `orgs.legal_name` has no unique constraint in `packages/db/src/schema/iam.ts:81`. The dialog copy explicitly says "Slug must be globally unique" — slug IS unique, legal_name is not.
- **Decision:** Enforce uniqueness (per repo owner — "do as you wish, but fix it").
- **Fix:**
  - Migration `0040_orgs_legal_name_unique.sql` — partial unique index on `LOWER(legal_name) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`. Case-insensitive, lets soft-deleted rows free their name for reuse.
  - `OrgRepository.findByLegalName(legalName)` added on the domain port + Drizzle impl.
  - `CreateOrgHandler` and `UpdateOrgHandler` now raise `ConflictError("Org legal name already taken: …")` before insert/save so the API returns a clean 409 with the same shape as the slug-collision path.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Fixed + verified end-to-end on production (commit `d753fd8`). Re-ran TC-A2-02 with duplicate legal name + different slug — API returned 409, error UI rendered "Org legal name already taken: Smoke Test Org Inc." inline (also confirms BUG-008 working).

### BUG-008 · API error body dumped as raw JSON to users · **major UX**
- **TC:** TC-A2-02 (surfaced when triggering 409)
- **Surface:** super-admin, org-admin, team-admin, player — every browser-issued mutation
- **Repro:**
  1. Trigger any 4xx/5xx from a client-side mutation (e.g. duplicate-slug create)
  2. Inline error UI shows: `API 409: {"error":{"code":"CONFLICT","message":"Org slug already taken: smoke-test-org"}}`
- **Expected:** Human message extracted from `error.message`: "Org slug already taken: smoke-test-org".
- **File(s):** `browser-api.ts` + `client.ts` in all four web apps (8 files). All threw `new Error(\`API ${res.status}: ${body}\`)` which surfaces raw JSON.
- **Fix:** Each wrapper now parses the JSON, prefers `parsed.error.message` → `parsed.message` → `parsed.error.code`, falls back to `API <status>` when the body isn't JSON. Attaches `status` + `body` to the thrown error for callers that want the structured form.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Fixed across all 8 files (commit `59d5121`) — verified during BUG-007 re-test: the legal-name 409 surfaced as `"Org legal name already taken: Smoke Test Org Inc."` cleanly, no JSON wrapper visible to user.

### BUG-021 · Org-admin "New team" form lowercases sport code; same FK violation as BUG-019 · **major**
- **TC:** TC-B6-01
- **Surface:** sp-org-admin · `/teams/new`
- **Repro:** Submit the form with any sport. The handler at line 33 calls `sportCode.trim().toLowerCase()`, so even if the user types `HOCKEY_ICE` it gets coerced to `hockey_ice` → FK violation → 500.
- **Fix:** Same shape as BUG-019 — converted the Input to a Select pre-populated with the 14 platform sports, defaulted to `HOCKEY_ICE`, removed the `.toLowerCase()` call.
- **File:** `apps/org-admin-web/src/app/(app)/teams/new/new-team-form.tsx`.
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — pending push + Vercel redeploy.

### BUG-020 · Org-admin "New division" form is missing the `gender` field listed in the spec · **minor**
- **TC:** TC-B5-01
- **Surface:** sp-org-admin · `/divisions/new`
- **Spec field list:** name, tier (A/B/C/D), gender (open / male / female / mixed), max teams cap.
- **Actual form:** season, name, tier (free-text), max teams. No gender selector.
- **Behaviour:** Backend silently defaults eligibility to "open". Form accepts the row, but the admin can't pick a gendered division at create time — they'd have to edit it later (and that surface may not exist yet either). Also: tier should be a dropdown of A/B/C/D per the kernel `PLAYER_LEVELS` constants instead of free-text.
- **File:** `apps/org-admin-web/src/app/(app)/divisions/new/...`.
- **Status:** Open. Logged for the next form-builder pass — not blocking the test sweep because the row creation succeeds.

### BUG-019 · Org-admin "New league" form takes free-text sport code; DB FK expects `HOCKEY_ICE` etc · **major**
- **TC:** TC-B3-01
- **Surface:** sp-org-admin · `/leagues/new`
- **Repro:**
  1. Sign in as an org_admin, switch to an empty org, click "Create league".
  2. Form pre-fills sport with placeholder `"hockey"`; hint says "hockey, soccer, basketball, etc".
  3. Submit → `500 INTERNAL_ERROR / An unexpected error occurred`.
- **Expected:** Either the dropdown is the source of truth + matches DB seeds, or the API normalises case before lookup.
- **Actual:** `public.sports` ships codes `HOCKEY_ICE`, `SOCCER`, `BASKETBALL`, etc (uppercase + underscores). `leagues.sport_code` FKs to that table. The handler passes the raw input to insert → 500 on FK violation. The form was a free-text input — direct violation of CLAUDE.md cardinal rule #4 ("Pre-existing entities are dropdowns, never free-text inputs").
- **File:** `apps/org-admin-web/src/app/(app)/leagues/new/new-league-form.tsx`.
- **Fix:** Form now uses a `<Select>` populated from the 14 active platform sports, default `HOCKEY_ICE` (mirrors the SA create-league dialog which already used a Select, though hardcoded to 3 sports). Backend retry with `HOCKEY_ICE` returned 201 + audit row `leagues.create`. Follow-up: stand up a public `/sports` endpoint so both surfaces share a single source of truth instead of duplicating the seed list.
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — pending push + Vercel redeploy.

### BUG-018 · sp-api CORS allowlist missing every web origin except sp-superadmin · **major**
- **TC:** TC-B3-01 (revealed every cross-origin write from sp-org-admin / sp-player / sp-team-admin)
- **Surface:** sp-api · `app.enableCors({ origin: CORS_ORIGIN.split(",") })`
- **Repro:** From sp-org-admin, hit any `sp-api-one.vercel.app` endpoint → preflight returns 204 with no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header → browser blocks with "No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present".
- **Expected:** Every deployed web surface is in the allowlist.
- **Actual:** Only `https://sp-superadmin.vercel.app` was in the env var, so every other app (org-admin, player, team-admin, landing) silently failed every cross-origin request.
- **Files:** `apps/superadmin-api/.env.example` — updated the documented contract.
- **Fix:** Updated `sp-api` Vercel env `CORS_ORIGIN` to a comma-separated list including all 5 production origins + localhost dev ports (3000–3004). Triggered a redeploy. Verified preflight from sp-org-admin now echoes `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://sp-org-admin.vercel.app`. `.env.example` updated with the full list so the contract lives in the repo.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Verified end-to-end. Cross-origin POSTs from sp-org-admin now succeed at the network layer (BUG-019 surfaced next).

### BUG-017 · Suspend doesn't actually block sign-in · **major (security gap)**
- **TC:** TC-A6-01
- **Surface:** sp-api · `SuspendProfileHandler` / `ReactivateProfileHandler` + super-admin `/users/[id]` Suspend button
- **Repro:**
  1. Open any user with credentials (e.g. `Invite Test Three` with `SmokeTest!2026`).
  2. Click Suspend → confirm.
  3. Sign in as that user on any app's sign-in page.
- **Expected:** Sign-in fails with "User is banned" (Supabase) or a "Your account has been suspended" message.
- **Actual:** `profiles.status='suspended'` is set, but `auth.users.banned_until` stays NULL. Supabase Auth still issues a valid JWT; nothing in middleware or any API guard checks `profiles.status`, so a suspended user retains full access until their JWT expires.
- **Files:**
  - `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/iam/application/commands/suspend-profile.command.ts`
  - `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/iam/application/commands/reactivate-profile.command.ts`
  - `apps/superadmin-api/src/shared/auth/supabase-admin.service.ts` — new `setUserBanned(userId, banned)` helper.
- **Fix:** Both handlers now call `SupabaseAdminService.setUserBanned(userId, true|false)` which calls Supabase admin `updateUserById({ ban_duration: '87600h' | 'none' })`. Errors are logged but don't roll back the DB write — the admin can re-run if Supabase is flaky. (10-year ban duration ≡ indefinite for our purposes; reactivate flips it back to `'none'`.)
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — pending push + Vercel redeploy. Verification post-deploy: suspend invtest3, try sign-in → expect "User is banned".

### BUG-016 · Cross-org grant "Issue grant" dialog user/target-org dropdowns empty — same limit=200 vs API cap=100 pattern · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A5-01
- **Surface:** super-admin · `/organizations/[id]` · "Issue grant" dialog
- **Repro:**
  1. Click "Issue grant" on an org page.
  2. Both "User" and "Target org" dropdowns render only the placeholder option.
- **Expected:** User dropdown lists all eligible users (18 in this env); Target org lists the other 3 orgs.
- **Actual:** `iam.listUsers({limit:200})` and `orgs.list({limit:200})` (server-rendered `allOrgs` prop) both return 400 `{"error":{"code":"BADREQUEST","message":"limit must not be greater than 100"}}`. The `.catch` swallows the error to empty array. Confirmed by direct curl. Same pattern as BUG-015 — there are at least 17 `limit:200` call sites in `superadmin-web` worth a broader sweep.
- **Files:**
  - `apps/superadmin-web/src/components/orgs/issue-grant-button.tsx` line 34.
  - `apps/superadmin-web/src/app/(admin)/organizations/[id]/page.tsx` line 81.
- **Fix:** Both lowered to limit=100. Backend test (direct `POST /cross-org-grants`) confirms the underlying grant pipeline (handler + audit interceptor) is healthy.
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — pending push + Vercel redeploy. Follow-up: broader sweep of remaining 15 `limit:200` call sites once tests reach them.

### BUG-015 · Assign-role panel's org list always "No orgs found" — sends limit=200, API caps at 100 · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A4-01
- **Surface:** super-admin · `/users/[id]` · "Assign new role" panel
- **Repro:**
  1. Open any user's detail page.
  2. In "Assign new role" change Role → `org_admin` (which auto-sets Scope type=org).
  3. The Scope dropdown reads "No orgs found — create one first.", Assign button disabled.
- **Expected:** Dropdown lists all orgs the super-admin can see (4 in this env: USA Hockey, Smoke Test Org, PPHL, Demo Hockey Club).
- **Actual:** `orgsApi.list({limit:200})` returns `400 {error:{code:'BADREQUEST', message:'limit must not be greater than 100'}}`. The fetcher's `.catch` block swallows the error to `setScopeOptions([])`, so the user sees a misleading empty-state.
- **File:** `apps/superadmin-web/src/components/roles/assign-role-panel.tsx` line 116.
- **Fix:** Drop the limit to 100 (matches ResourcePicker, which is why the same orgs render fine in the Invite dialog's picker). Follow-up: surface the catch's error in the hint so a future failure doesn't masquerade as "no data".
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — pending push + Vercel redeploy.

### BUG-014 · SetRoleProfileHandler can't create nested `metadata.roleProfile.<role>` path on a fresh profile · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A3-03
- **Surface:** sp-api · `iam.setRoleProfile` (PATCH `/iam/users/:id/role-profile`)
- **Repro:**
  1. Invite a new user via the Invite dialog with "Also grant a role on invite" + "Also set up the <role> profile now" checked.
  2. Fill the profile fields (e.g. org_admin → title + phone) and submit.
  3. Query `profiles.metadata` for the new user — comes back `{}` even though the API returned 200 and the `users.role-profile` audit row recorded `{ok:true}`.
- **Expected:** `profiles.metadata = {"roleProfile": {"org_admin": {"title": "...", "phone": "..."}}}`.
- **Actual:** Postgres `jsonb_set` with `create_if_missing=true` only creates the LEAF key. When the `roleProfile` parent doesn't exist yet (brand-new profile with `metadata = {}`), the function silently returns the input unchanged — `SELECT jsonb_set('{}'::jsonb, ARRAY['roleProfile','org_admin'], '{...}'::jsonb, true)` returns `{}`. So every first-time profile write was a silent no-op.
- **File:** `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/iam/application/commands/set-role-profile.command.ts`.
- **Fix:** Two-step jsonb_set — step 1 ensures the `roleProfile` parent exists (sets it to `coalesce(metadata -> 'roleProfile', '{}'::jsonb)`), step 2 sets the per-role leaf. Verified at SQL level: the corrected query persists `{roleProfile: {org_admin: {title, phone}}}` on both invtest4 (magic-link path) and invtest5 (auto-confirm path).
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — backfilled existing rows directly via SQL. Pending push + Vercel redeploy for the live API to use the fix.

### BUG-013 · Audit interceptor silently drops events under Vercel · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A3-01, TC-A7-01
- **Surface:** sp-api · global audit pipeline
- **Repro:**
  1. Make any 2xx mutation via the deployed sp-api (e.g. invite a user)
  2. Query `audit_events` for the action — no row.
  3. Older invites from the local-dev era ARE audited, confirming the writer worked once.
- **Expected:** Every successful POST/PATCH/DELETE produces an audit row.
- **Actual:** The interceptor called `void this.writer.write(...)` inside a `tap`. RxJS `tap` is fire-and-forget — it doesn't await the returned Promise. On Vercel, the serverless function terminates as soon as the HTTP response is flushed, killing the in-flight audit insert before it lands.
- **Fix:** `audit.interceptor.ts` switched from `tap(...)` to `switchMap` over `from(this.writeFromRequest(...))`. The interceptor now AWAITS the audit write before the response flows downstream, so the serverless function lifetime is held open until the row commits (~50ms / write). Writer still swallows its own errors via try/catch so a flaky audit can't break the underlying mutation.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Verified end-to-end. After redeploy, the `Invite Test Two` invite produced an `invite.create` audit row with `actor_user_id` set to the super-admin. (Note: `resource_id` still null — the response body returns `userId`, not `id`, so the interceptor's loose key-lookup misses it. Tracked as a follow-up — see test plan TC-A7-01.)

### BUG-009 · Invited user's `display_name` not propagated to `profiles` · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A3-01
- **Surface:** super-admin · /users · Invite user dialog
- **Repro:**
  1. Invite a new email + display name "Invite Test One"
  2. After submit, query `profiles` for the new user
- **Expected:** `profiles.display_name = 'Invite Test One'`.
- **Actual:** `display_name IS NULL`. The trigger `handle_new_user` (in Postgres) only inserts `(id, email)` and ignores `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.display_name` even though the API DOES set that field via Supabase admin's `user_metadata: { display_name }`.
- **Fix:** Migration `0041_handle_new_user_display_name.sql` rewrites the trigger to read `meta->>'display_name'` (plus `legal_first_name` / `legal_last_name` for symmetry with the self-registration funnel) and `NULLIF` empty-string. Backfill UPDATE applied for the existing test row.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Verified end-to-end. New invite "Invite Test Two" landed with `profiles.display_name='Invite Test Two'`.

### BUG-006 · Org-create slug pattern attribute throws SyntaxError under Chrome /v regex · **major**
- **TC:** TC-A2-01
- **Surface:** super-admin · /organizations · Create org dialog
- **Repro:**
  1. Open the Create-org dialog
  2. Open DevTools console
  3. Observe: `Pattern attribute value ^[a-z0-9-]{2,60}$ is not a valid regular expression: Invalid regular expression: /^[a-z0-9-]{2,60}$/v: Invalid character class`
- **Expected:** Pattern compiles silently.
- **Actual:** Chrome's HTML pattern attribute now uses the /v unicode flag. Under /v, a literal `-` inside a character class must be escaped or first/last — `[a-z0-9-]` is rejected.
- **File:** `apps/superadmin-web/src/components/orgs/create-org-button.tsx` line 119.
- **Notes on the fix:** First attempt (`^[-a-z0-9]{2,60}$` with leading hyphen) also failed under /v with "Invalid character in character class". Tested locally — under /v, `[a-z0-9-]`, `[-a-z0-9]`, and `[a-z0-9\-]` ALL fail. The only safe form keeps the hyphen OUT of any character class: `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`. Length now enforced via the adjacent `minLength={2}` / `maxLength={60}` HTML attrs.
- **Status:** ✅✅ Fixed in commit (this run) — verified via `new RegExp(..., 'v')` locally; pending push + Vercel redeploy.

### BUG-005 · FinanceModule + RegistrationComplianceModule DI graphs broken · **blocker**
- **TC:** TC-A2-01 (revealed during sp-api boot after fixing BUG-004)
- **Surface:** sp-api boot
- **Repro:** Boot the API locally (`pnpm --filter @sportspulse/superadmin-api start:dev`).
- **Expected:** Nest application successfully started.
- **Actual:**
  - `PlayerPaymentsController` injects `NotificationService` but `FinanceModule` didn't import `CommunicationsModule`.
  - `ComplianceCronController` injects `ComplianceSweepsController` but `ComplianceSweepsController` was only registered as a `controller`, not a `provider`, so Nest can't resolve it.
- **Files:**
  - `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/finance/finance.module.ts` — added `imports: [CommunicationsModule]`.
  - `apps/superadmin-api/src/modules/registration-compliance/registration-compliance.module.ts` — added `ComplianceSweepsController` to `providers` (it's `@Injectable()` under the hood, but Nest doesn't auto-register controllers in the DI graph).
- **Status:** ✅ Fixed locally — Nest boots clean. Pending push + Vercel redeploy.

# A. Platform & user setup

> Owner: super_admin. Surface: `apps/superadmin-web`.

### TC-A1-01 · Super-admin sign-in (happy path)
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** Visit `https://sp-superadmin.vercel.app/sign-in` → enter `alex@sp.test` + password → submit.
- **Expected:** Redirect to `/`, sees Federation dashboard, KPIs render, no console errors.

### TC-A1-02 · Sign-in failure (wrong password)
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** Same as above with wrong password.
- **Expected:** Inline error "Invalid login credentials". No redirect.

### TC-A1-03 · Sign-in failure (wrong role)
- **Role:** org_admin (no super_admin grant)
- **Steps:** Sign in at `sp-superadmin.vercel.app/sign-in` as `org@sp.test`.
- **Expected:** Bounced to `/sign-in?error=wrong_role` with the matching banner. **Cross-surface:** signing in at `sp-org-admin.vercel.app/sign-in` with the same account works.

### TC-A1-04 · Sign-out clears every app
- **Steps:** Signed in to super-admin and org-admin in same browser → click sign-out on super-admin.
- **Expected:** super-admin redirects to `/sign-in?error=signed_out`. Visiting org-admin must NOT silently re-auth — per the 2026-05-09 directive each app has its own session.

### TC-A1-05 · Magic-link sign-in
- **Steps:** On `/sign-in`, enter email only → "Send sign-in link" → check inbox → click link.
- **Expected:** Lands signed in. JWT carries the role app_metadata.

### TC-A1-06 · `/auth/callback` exchange
- **Steps:** Open the link from TC-A1-05 in a new private window (no existing session).
- **Expected:** `/auth/callback?code=…` exchanges, sets cookies, redirects to `/`. **All four web apps** (superadmin, org-admin, team-admin, player) must have an `/auth/callback` route.

### TC-A1-07 · Session expiry mid-flow
- **Steps:** Sign in → wait for JWT to expire (or force-expire in dev) → navigate to any page.
- **Expected:** API returns 401 → app intercepts → redirect to `/sign-in?error=session_expired&next=…`. No crashed UI, no infinite redirect loop.

### TC-A2-01 · Create an organization
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** `/organizations` → "New org" → fill display name, legal name, country → submit.
- **Expected:** Row appears in list. Audit row written: `orgs.create` with the new id.
- **Cross-surface:** sign in to org-admin as a user granted org_admin on this new org — switcher shows the new org.

### TC-A2-02 · Org legal name uniqueness
- **Steps:** Create org with legal name X. Try to create another with the same legal name.
- **Expected:** 409 with helpful message. Form re-enabled.

### TC-A3-01 · Invite a user by email (auto-confirm OFF)
- **Pre-conditions:** `SUPABASE_REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRM=true` on `sp-api`.
- **Steps:** `/users` → "Invite user" → enter email → submit.
- **Expected:** Resend delivers a confirmation email. User row created in `auth.users` with email_confirmed_at = NULL. Inviter sees a copy/paste fallback if Resend isn't wired.
- **Cross-surface:** Invited user opens the email link, sets a password, lands signed in on the matching role app.

### TC-A3-02 · Invite a user by email (auto-confirm ON, dev)
- **Pre-conditions:** `SUPABASE_REQUIRE_EMAIL_CONFIRM=false`.
- **Steps:** Same as above.
- **Expected:** User created, `email_confirmed_at` populated immediately. No verification email is required to sign in.

### TC-A3-03 · Invite with profile setup (single flow)
- **Steps:** "Invite user" → fill name + role profile in the SAME dialog → submit.
- **Expected:** User created, profile populated, role assignment made — all in one transaction. No "find user → click roles → edit profile" multi-step.
- **Why:** Cardinal-rule fix (CLAUDE.md "connected actions belong in connected dialogs").

### TC-A4-01 · Assign a role
- **Steps:** `/users/[id]` → Roles section → "Add role" → pick `org_admin`, scope=Org-A → submit.
- **Expected:** Assignment row inserted. User's `app_metadata.role_codes` refreshed via Supabase admin. **Cross-surface:** they can now sign in to org-admin and see Org-A in the switcher.

### TC-A4-02 · Revoke a role
- **Steps:** Same row → Revoke.
- **Expected:** `revoked_at` populated. Role disappears from listed assignments. User's app_metadata re-synced. Their sign-in to org-admin now bounces with `wrong_role`.

### TC-A4-03 · Dropdown defaults reflect context
- **Steps:** On a super_admin user, open "Change user type" dropdown.
- **Expected:** Defaults to **super_admin**, not coach (alphabetic-first). Same rule for "Edit role profile" — opens the matching role's form, not the player default.
- **Why:** Cardinal-rule fix from 2026-05-09. See CLAUDE.md.

### TC-A5-01 · Cross-org grant
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** `/organizations/[id]` → cross-org grants → grant a user from Org-B view-only on Org-A.
- **Expected:** That user, signed in to org-admin and switching to Org-A, sees read-only pages (every write CTA absent or disabled).

### TC-A6-01 · Suspend / reactivate user
- **Steps:** `/users/[id]` → Suspend → choose reason.
- **Expected:** User can no longer sign in (`AccessDenied`). All their queued notifications still in outbox but not new ones fire. Reactivate restores sign-in.

### TC-A7-01 · Audit log records every mutation
- **Steps:** Perform any 2xx-returning POST/PATCH/DELETE from any app.
- **Expected:** A row in `audit_events` with `actor_id=user.id`, `action=<resource>.<verb>`, `resource_id`, the before/after diff.
- **Cross-surface:** Visit `/audit` on superadmin-web → the row shows up. On org-admin-web `/audit` → only rows scoped to the active org appear.

### TC-A7-02 · Audit log filter
- **Steps:** `/audit` → filter by actor + action.
- **Expected:** Results narrow; pagination cursor works.

### TC-A7-03 · Audit detail view
- **Steps:** Click any audit row.
- **Expected:** Detail page shows before/after JSON. `resourceId` null-guarded — never crashes when no resource id is recorded.

---

# B. Org setup (org-admin)

> Owner: org_admin. Surface: `apps/org-admin-web`.

### TC-B1-01 · Org-admin sign-in
- **Role:** org_admin
- **Steps:** Sign in at `sp-org-admin.vercel.app/sign-in`.
- **Expected:** Lands on `/` — overview page. Input fields carry accessible names (verify via Playwright snapshot — `textbox "Email"` not bare `textbox`). Fix from commit `20c07fe`.

### TC-B1-02 · Org-admin without org grant
- **Role:** noroles
- **Steps:** Sign in as a user with no active assignments.
- **Expected:** Bounced to `/onboarding` or the empty-state shell ("No organization yet").

### TC-B2-01 · Active-org switcher (multi-org user)
- **Pre-conditions:** User holds org_admin on both Org-A and Org-B.
- **Steps:** Sign in → switcher visible in top-bar → flip to Org-B.
- **Expected:** Cookie `active_org_id` set. Page refreshes. Overview KPIs now reflect Org-B. Every sub-page (leagues / seasons / divisions / teams / registrations / finance / disputes / communications / audit) reads from Org-B.

### TC-B2-02 · Switcher hidden when scope ≤ 1 org
- **Steps:** Sign in as a single-org user.
- **Expected:** Switcher not rendered. `getActiveOrgId(scope)` falls back to `scope.orgIds[0]`.

### TC-B2-03 · Switcher persists across reloads + new tabs
- **Steps:** Switch to Org-B → reload → open a new tab.
- **Expected:** Both tabs show Org-B.

### TC-B3-01 · Create league (org-scoped)
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW** (Backlog #6)
- **Steps:** `/leagues` → "New league" → name + sport code (e.g. `hockey`) + format → Create.
- **Expected:** API `POST /org-admin/leagues` accepts. Row appears in `/leagues`. Audit row written. **Cross-surface:** super-admin `/leagues` also lists it.

### TC-B3-02 · Create league outside scope
- **Steps:** Tamper with the request body's `orgId` to point at Org-B (which the caller has no grant on).
- **Expected:** 403 with `org_admin required` message. No row created.

### TC-B3-03 · Empty-state CTA on the dashboard
- **Pre-conditions:** Org with zero leagues.
- **Steps:** Sign in.
- **Expected:** Overview's Leagues section shows EmptyState + a "Create league" button linking to `/leagues/new`.

### TC-B4-01 · Create season (under a league)
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW**
- **Steps:** `/seasons` → "New season" → pick league → name + start/end date + optional registration window + roster lock → Create.
- **Expected:** Season created with denormalised `orgId` matching the league's parent. Form validates `endDate >= startDate`. Roster-lock-at saved if provided.
- **Edge:** Pick a league not in scope → 404 (not 403, per the no-leak rule).

### TC-B4-02 · Empty-state when no leagues
- **Steps:** Go to `/seasons/new` before creating any league.
- **Expected:** EmptyState "No leagues yet — create one first" + link to `/leagues/new`.

### TC-B5-01 · Create division
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW**
- **Steps:** `/divisions/new` → pick season → name (e.g. `A-Div`) → tier (e.g. `A`) → gender (open / male / female / mixed) → max teams cap → Create.
- **Expected:** Division created under that season. `playoffConfig` defaults `{}`.
- **Edge:** `maxTeams < 2` → form blocks with "Max teams must be 2 or more".

### TC-B5-02 · Empty-state when no seasons
- **Steps:** Go to `/divisions/new` before creating any season.
- **Expected:** EmptyState + link to `/seasons/new`.

### TC-B6-01 · Create team
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW**
- **Steps:** `/teams/new` → name + sport + optional short name + optional logo URL → Create.
- **Expected:** Team created with `orgId=activeOrg`. Form lands on `/teams/[teamId]` so user can immediately assign a captain.
- **Cross-surface:** superadmin `/teams/[id]` shows the new team.

### TC-B7-01 · Assign a captain to a team
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW** (Backlog #17a)
- **Steps:** `/teams/[teamId]` → "Assign captain" → paste user UUID → submit.
- **Expected:** `user_role_assignments` row inserted with `scope_type=team / scope_id=teamId / role.code=captain`. `teams.captain_user_id` synced. Captain appears in the captains list with their display name + email.
- **Cross-surface:** that user signs in to team-admin → sees the captain console with Team-1 selected.

### TC-B7-02 · Revoke a captain
- **Steps:** Same page → click "Revoke" on a captain row → confirm.
- **Expected:** `revoked_at` populated. `teams.captain_user_id` cleared if it pointed at the revoked user. The user signs in to team-admin → no longer in captain mode.

### TC-B7-03 · Assign captain — invalid UUID
- **Steps:** Paste `not-a-uuid`.
- **Expected:** Client-side validation rejects before POSTing.

### TC-B7-04 · Assign captain — non-existent user
- **Steps:** Paste a real-looking UUID that isn't in `profiles`.
- **Expected:** 400 "Target user not found".

### TC-B7-05 · Assign captain — out of scope
- **Steps:** Tamper with `:teamId` to a team in Org-B.
- **Expected:** 404 (not 403).

# C. League / season / division setup

> Already covered in B for org-admin. This section is the super-admin
> god-app path, which is the reference implementation.

### TC-C1-01 · Org-setup wizard (god app)
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** `/org-setup` → pick org → pick sport → pick governing body → name the league → season dates → divisions (with tier + gender + cap) → review → submit.
- **Expected:** Single transaction creates league + season + N divisions. Wizard step numbers and runtime calls match exactly (catches bug #1 from CLAUDE.md — stepper visited 1→2→4→5→3→6).

### TC-C1-02 · Wizard returning user
- **Steps:** Start wizard for an org that already has leagues/seasons — pre-fill should not propose duplicates.
- **Expected:** Defaults reflect existing state; user can pick "extend existing season" rather than create a parallel one.

### TC-C2-01 · Edit league
- **Steps:** `/leagues/[id]` → change name → save.
- **Expected:** Optimistic update on the list. Audit row.

### TC-C2-02 · Change league status
- **Steps:** `/leagues/[id]` → status menu → archive.
- **Expected:** Confirmation prompt. Archived leagues hide from default `/leagues` filter (but visible with toggle).

### TC-C3-01 · Season config patch
- **Steps:** `/seasons/[id]` → registration window editor → set opens/closes.
- **Expected:** PATCH `/league/seasons/:id/config` persists. Public funnel respects the dates.

### TC-C3-02 · Season config — roster lock
- **Steps:** Set `rosterLockAt` to now+5 min → wait → try to add a player as captain.
- **Expected:** Captain UI hides the action bar; API returns 409 with `Roster locked` if you bypass UI.

### TC-C4-01 · Division rule overrides
- **Steps:** `/divisions/[id]` → edit `ruleSetOverrides` (e.g. `maxRosterSize: 18`, `maxGuestPlayersPerGame: 2`).
- **Expected:** Captain's add-player flow respects the override (caught the original "guest cap" CLAUDE.md bug).

### TC-C4-02 · Division applications queue
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** `/division-applications` → pick season → review pending entries.
- **Expected:** Each row shows team + captain + collected/threshold. Approve and Reject CTAs work.

# D. Registration funnel (public)

> Surface: `apps/superadmin-web/registration/[id]/...` (the public funnel page lives outside the `(admin)` group) and `apps/player-web/register`. Anonymous.

### TC-D1-01 · Funnel renders for an open registration
- **Pre-conditions:** Season-S has open registration; one form published.
- **Steps:** Open `/registration/<form-id>` as an anonymous user.
- **Expected:** Welcome screen renders. Stepper shows steps in display order.

### TC-D1-02 · Stepper visits in display order (regression for bug #1)
- **Steps:** Walk the funnel start to finish, watching the stepper.
- **Expected:** Highlight transitions follow `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6` — never `1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 3 → 6`.
- **Why:** This bug shipped once; per CLAUDE.md it must never recur.

### TC-D1-03 · Spec fields → form fields parity
- **Steps:** Compare every step's input list to the form spec.
- **Expected:** Every spec field present. Labels match domain terms verbatim (no `maxGuestPlayersPerGame` → "Max post-game players" drift).

### TC-D1-04 · Enum field renders as dropdown
- **Steps:** Find any enum field (overtime length, status, role, tier, gender).
- **Expected:** `<select>` with the canonical values — never a bare `<input type="number">`.
- **Why:** CLAUDE.md rule #7.

### TC-D1-05 · Pre-existing entity → dropdown
- **Steps:** Wherever the form needs a season / league / division — verify it's a dropdown pre-populated from the database, never free-text.
- **Why:** CLAUDE.md rule #4.

### TC-D2-01 · Anonymous → submitted
- **Role:** public
- **Steps:** Open funnel → fill every required field → submit.
- **Expected:** Success screen ("admin will review") with reference id. Row in `registrations` with `status=submitted` or `pending_review`.
- **Cross-surface:** super-admin `/registrations` → row appears in the correct status filter. **Important regression:** review queue must default to a filter that includes the new row (catches the "pending_offline rows invisible" CLAUDE.md bug).

### TC-D2-02 · Returning user (account exists)
- **Steps:** Submit funnel with an email already registered.
- **Expected:** Funnel detects and offers "sign in to attach this submission to your account" without losing form state.

### TC-D2-03 · Minor registrant → parental consent
- **Pre-conditions:** Org has parental-consent enabled in season config.
- **Steps:** Submit funnel with DOB making subject < 18.
- **Expected:** Submission marked `pending_consent`. Parent receives email with `/parental-consent/[token]` link.
- **Cross-surface:** open the parent link in a new browser → see consent page (see TC-J3-01).

### TC-D2-04 · Free-agent path
- **Pre-conditions:** Season allows free agents.
- **Steps:** In funnel, pick "I don't have a team" → fill availability + positions.
- **Expected:** `free_agent_pool_entries` row created. Captains can browse it.

### TC-D2-05 · Funnel with payment (mock Stripe)
- **Pre-conditions:** Season requires payment.
- **Steps:** Reach payment step → submit mock card.
- **Expected:** Sub-invoice created against the team master invoice. `paidCents` advances. Status flips to `pending_review` or `approved` per workflow.

### TC-D2-06 · Funnel with offline payment toggle
- **Steps:** Pick "Pay offline" instead of card.
- **Expected:** Submission lands `pending_offline`. Admin gets notified. Review queue's default filter MUST include `pending_offline` (CLAUDE.md bug #2).

### TC-D2-07 · Invite-token funnel (captain invited)
- **Pre-conditions:** Captain sent an invite via TC-F1-04.
- **Steps:** Anonymous user opens `/register?token=<inviteToken>` (or the public route the email links to).
- **Expected:** Funnel pre-fills team + season + division from the token. Submitting attaches the player to that team's roster on approval.

### TC-D3-01 · Player discovers published forms
- **Role:** player (signed-in, no team)
- **Steps:** Sign in to player-web → land on overview.
- **Expected:** A surface lists open forms / open registrations they can submit. **Important regression:** CLAUDE.md bug #3 ("Player can log in but no discoverable path to any published form") — this surface MUST exist.

---

# E. Registration review (admin)

### TC-E1-01 · Super-admin review queue
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** `/registrations` → default filter → see all submitted + pending rows.
- **Expected:** Submissions from public funnel appear without changing the filter. Bulk actions visible.

### TC-E1-02 · Approve single registration
- **Steps:** Click a row → "Approve" → optional reason.
- **Expected:** State transitions `submitted → approved`. Recipient notified via `registration.approved` template. Audit row written.

### TC-E1-03 · Reject single
- **Steps:** "Reject" → enter reason.
- **Expected:** `submitted → rejected`. `registration.rejected` email fired with reason in the body.

### TC-E1-04 · Bulk approve
- **Steps:** Tick N rows → "Approve N" → confirm.
- **Expected:** All transition. One notification per row. Audit row per row.

### TC-E1-05 · Override compliance flag
- **Steps:** Click an `incomplete` registration with a flag → "Override flag" → justify.
- **Expected:** Flag override written into `registrations.metadata.flagOverrides[<flag>]` with `{overriddenBy, overriddenAt, justification}`. Submission re-evaluated.

### TC-E2-01 · Org-admin review (approve)
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW** (Backlog #6 — commit `e81ab67`)
- **Steps:** `/registrations` → pending row → "Approve".
- **Expected:** API `POST /org-admin/registrations/:id/review { action: approve }` succeeds. State `submitted → approved`. `registration.approved` notification queued via the catalog template.
- **Cross-surface:** the registrant's player-web → registration card flips to Approved.

### TC-E2-02 · Org-admin review (reject with reason)
- **Steps:** Click "Reject" → reason appears inline → confirm.
- **Expected:** State `submitted → rejected`. `decisionReason` saved. Rejection email fired.

### TC-E2-03 · Org-admin review — out of scope
- **Steps:** Tamper with `:id` to a registration whose `orgId` is Org-B.
- **Expected:** 404 (not 403).

### TC-E2-04 · Org-admin review — invalid state
- **Steps:** Try to approve an already-approved row.
- **Expected:** State machine rejects. 403/422. No double-notification.

### TC-E2-05 · Org-admin cannot override flags
- **Steps:** Inspect the row UI for an `incomplete` submission.
- **Expected:** No "Override flag" action surfaced. API call directly to `/org-admin/registrations/:id/review { action: override_flag }` is rejected — that action stays super-admin-only by design.

### TC-E3-01 · Captain rollover wizard (D2)
- **Role:** captain · existing team with last season's roster
- **Steps:** `/captain/register` → walk wizard → import prior season's roster → submit.
- **Expected:** 8-write atomic submission. Master invoice + sub-invoices + invites created. `division_team_entries.entry_status = applied`.
- **Cross-surface:** super-admin `/division-applications` shows the new entry. Org-admin `/teams/[teamId]` shows the same. Each invited player receives `TEAM_INVITE_NEW`.

---

# F. Team management (captain / coach)

> Owner: captain (or super_admin bypass). Surface: `apps/team-admin-web`.

### TC-F1-01 · Captain dashboard mode
- **Role:** captain
- **Steps:** Sign in → land on `/`.
- **Expected:** Top banner pulses if registration mode is `registration_open`. Sidebar "Register the team" entry pulses in sync. **Both render together** (CLAUDE.md cardinal: connected actions).

### TC-F1-02 · Roster list
- **Steps:** `/captain/roster`.
- **Expected:** Active memberships listed. Each row shows name, jersey, position. Lock state visible if past `rosterLockAt`.

### TC-F1-03 · Add player to roster
- **Steps:** Click add → pick person from registered players list → optional jersey/position → save.
- **Expected:** `roster_moves` add + `team_memberships` insert in one transaction. Roster count increments.
- **Edge:** at cap → 409 "Roster is full".

### TC-F1-04 · Invite a player by email
- **Steps:** Invite panel → enter email → optional split amount → Send.
- **Expected:** `team_invites` row with token. Email queued via `TEAM_INVITE_NEW`. Expiry = season close OR default TTL (whichever earlier).

### TC-F1-05 · Resend invite reminder
- **Steps:** Same invite → "Remind".
- **Expected:** Cooldown ≥ 24h. Extension count <= MAX_INVITE_EXTENSIONS. Expiry pushed to +7d. `INVITE_REMINDER_2` queued.

### TC-F1-06 · Drop a player
- **Steps:** Active membership → Drop → enter reason ≥ 20 chars.
- **Expected:** Status flips to `released`. `roster_moves` drop row. If sub-invoice paid → `refund_assessments` pending row created.
- **Cross-surface:** org-admin `/disputes` queue shows the new pending assessment.

### TC-F1-07 · Add a guest player to a single game
- **Pre-conditions:** Game G between Team-1 (your team) and Team-2.
- **Steps:** `/captain/roster/[teamId]/guest` flow → pick game + person.
- **Expected:** `game_attendance` row with `isGuest=true`. Cap checks honoured (max per game + max per season per player). Walk-in shell person created when no `personId` given.

### TC-F1-08 · Transfer initiation (Workflow 7B Case 6)
- **Steps:** Roster row menu → Transfer to another team → submit.
- **Expected:** `transfer_requests` row → notifies receiving captain. Admin approval required.

### TC-F2-01 · Captain console role-gate
- **Role:** coach (NOT captain) on Team-1
- **Steps:** Open captain-only pages.
- **Expected:** Permitted reads succeed. Mutations (add / drop / invite) return 403. Sidebar hides captain-only entries.

### TC-F2-02 · Super_admin bypass
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** Visit captain pages of any team.
- **Expected:** All captain actions usable (per CLAUDE.md "captains can be assigned without super-admin… but super-admin still passes through").

### TC-F3-01 · Captain dues view
- **Role:** captain
- **Steps:** `/captain/dues`.
- **Expected:** Master invoice + per-player breakdown. "Remind all unpaid" + "Cover outstanding" CTAs.

### TC-F3-02 · Remind all unpaid

- **Steps:** `/schedule`.
- **Expected:** Upcoming games for the player's team listed with date/time/opponent/venue.

### TC-G1-02 · Game schedule (team-admin)
- **Role:** captain
- **Steps:** `/schedule`.
- **Expected:** Same data, captain-style table.

### TC-G2-01 · Lineup editor (captain)
- **Role:** captain
- **Steps:** `/lineups` → click an upcoming game → editor.
- **Expected:** Active roster only (released/suspended hidden). Radio buckets for starter / bench / scratch. Jersey + position inputs editable.
- **Edge:** No active roster → EmptyState "No active roster" with icon (Users). Catches the previously-broken missing-`icon`-prop case.

### TC-G2-02 · Lineup save
- **Steps:** Set 6 starters + 12 bench + 1 scratch → Save.
- **Expected:** `game_lineups` upsert on `(game_id, team_id)`. Lock state still `null`.

### TC-G2-03 · Lineup locks on game start
- **Steps:** Move game to `in_play` (super_admin via `/games/[id]` action).

### TC-H2-01 · Record offline payment (org-admin)
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW** (Backlog #6 — commit `a8da7e2`)
- **Steps:** `/finance` → click an open invoice → inline "Record payment" → enter amount, method (cash / check / etransfer / etc.), date, notes → submit.
- **Expected:** `POST /org-admin/finance/invoices/:id/payments` succeeds. `payments` row inserted with `recordedByUserId=user.id`. `invoices.paidCents` advanced. Status flips to `paid` if remaining reaches 0; else `partially_paid`. Captain's `/captain/dues` reflects the new balance.

### TC-H2-02 · Record payment exceeds remaining

### TC-I2-01 · Per-template preferences
- **Role:** any signed-in user
- **Steps:** `/notifications/me/preferences` or the matching UI page.
- **Expected:** Lists every TEMPLATE_CODE × channel pair with toggle. Save flips `notification_preferences`. Opt-out makes future dispatch mark `suppressed` (not `failed`).

### TC-I2-02 · Per-template preference — push channel
- **Steps:** Same page → "push" toggle for any template.
- **Expected:** Persists. Push dispatcher honours the opt-out exactly like email.
- **NEW** (Backlog #16 — channel allowed by migration 0039).

### TC-I3-01 · Compose broadcast (org-admin)
- **Role:** org_admin · **NEW** (Backlog #6 — commit `841e4c4`)
- **Steps:** `/communications/compose` → tick `captains` + `team_admins` → subject + body → channel `email` → Send.
- **Expected:** API `POST /org-admin/broadcast` returns `queued: N, audiencesResolved: M`. `notifications` rows inserted with `templateCode=org.broadcast` (1 per resolved recipient). Idempotency key `broadcast-<id>-<personId>`.

### TC-I3-02 · Compose broadcast — multi-audience union
- **Steps:** Tick all four audiences.
- **Expected:** Same recipient covered by multiple audiences gets exactly **one** row (de-duped via `personId` Set in resolver).

### TC-I3-03 · Compose broadcast — opt-out honoured
- **Pre-conditions:** Player has opted-out of `org.broadcast` email.
- **Steps:** Send broadcast targeting that player.
- **Expected:** Notification queued but immediately marked `suppressed` (per `isOptedOut` check in NotificationService).

### TC-I3-04 · Compose broadcast — in-app channel
- **Steps:** Same form → channel = `in_app`.
- **Expected:** Notifications appear in the recipient's player-web `/notifications` page on next refresh. `unread_count` increments.

### TC-I4-01 · Email template override per (season, eventType)
- **Steps:** `/communications/templates` → create override for `on_approved` scoped to Season-S → set subject + bodyHtml.
- **Expected:** Saved row in `email_templates`. Next approval on Season-S uses the override (verify in the queued notification body); approvals on Season-T still use the catalog default.

### TC-I5-01 · Push subscription register (browser)
- **Role:** player or captain · **NEW** (Backlog #16)
- **Steps:** From any app, request notification permission → service worker subscribes via web-push → POST `/communications/push/subscribe` with endpoint + p256dh + auth.

### TC-I5-02 · Push subscription list
- **Steps:** GET `/communications/push`.
- **Expected:** Only the caller's subscriptions returned.

### TC-I5-03 · Push subscription delete
- **Steps:** DELETE `/communications/push/:id`.

### TC-I5-04 · Push dispatch (log-only — VAPID unset)
- **Pre-conditions:** `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` unset.
- **Steps:** Queue a notification with `channel=push` to a user with active subs.
- **Expected:** PushDispatcherService logs `[push:…] log-only (VAPID keys unset)`. Notification stays `failed` (so the retry-failed cron picks it up later). No crash.

### TC-I5-05 · Push dispatch (real provider)
- **Pre-conditions:** VAPID keys configured + `web-push` lib bundled.
- **Steps:** Same as above.
- **Expected:** Real push sent to each active subscription. 410-gone responses soft-disable the offending endpoint via `deactivateEndpoint`.

### TC-I6-01 · Notifications retry-failed cron (pg_cron)
- **Pre-conditions:** Failed notification rows present.
- **Steps:** Wait for the next pg_cron tick OR `SELECT cron.schedule('once-now', '1 minute', $$…$$)`.
- **Expected:** pg_net POSTs `/communications/cron/retry-failed` with `X-Cron-Secret`. CronSecretGuard accepts. Rows re-dispatched. Same backoff strategy across email + push.

### TC-J2-01 · Each app's sign-in page is keyboard-accessible
- **Role:** public
- **Steps:** Tab through `/sign-in` on all four apps.
- **Expected:** Focus order: email → password → submit. Email + password labels read by screen-readers (regression for the `Field` a11y bug fixed in commit `20c07fe`).

### TC-J2-02 · Sign-up page on each role app
- **Steps:** Visit `/sign-up` on each.
- **Expected:** Creates account scoped to the matching role (or hands off to invite flow if open sign-up is disabled).

### TC-J3-01 · Parent portal — valid token
- **Role:** public · parent
- **Pre-conditions:** A minor's registration triggered a consent email; parent has the URL.
- **Steps:** Open `https://sp-player-red.vercel.app/parental-consent/[token]`.
- **Expected:** Middleware whitelists the path (no sign-in redirect). API `GET /public/registration/parental-consent/:token` returns context. Page renders child name + season + org + decision buttons.

### TC-J3-02 · Parent portal — confirm
- **Steps:** Click "Confirm consent".
- **Expected:** POST `…/redeem { action: confirm }` succeeds. Submission moves out of `pending_consent`. Confirmation screen. Original submitter's player-web reflects approval next time they log in.

### TC-J3-03 · Parent portal — decline
- **Steps:** Click "Decline".
- **Expected:** Submission moves to `cancelled` (or `rejected` per workflow). Email confirms decision to parent.

- **Steps:** Garbled token in URL.
- **Expected:** "Invalid link" screen. No information leak about whether a submission exists.

### TC-J4-01 · Anonymous `/register` route on player-web
- **Steps:** Open `/register` while signed out.
- **Expected:** Middleware whitelists the path. Funnel renders (links into the funnel pages on superadmin-web `/registration/[id]` if that's where forms live).

---

# K. Compliance & eligibility

### TC-K1-01 · Eligibility verification (USA Hockey)
- **Steps:** Submit registration with a USA Hockey number → workflow runs verification.
- **Expected:** `eligibility_records` row with `verified=true` if number matches. UI shows verified badge.

### TC-K1-02 · Eligibility flag on mismatch

- **Pre-conditions:** Season-S with `rosterLockAt < now()` and `last_lock_sweep_at` either null or older.
- **Steps:** Hourly pg_cron tick fires.
- **Expected:** Per-team check; teams with non-compliant rosters get `COMPLIANCE_SWEEP_COMPLETE` once (idempotent via `last_lock_sweep_at` advance — catches the spammy-notification bug).

### TC-K4-01 · Playoff eligibility gate
- **Pre-conditions:** Player below `minGamesForPlayoffs`.
- **Steps:** Captain tries to add them as a guest on a playoff game.

- **Expected:** Idempotent. Same result regardless of how many times called.

### TC-L2-01 · Leaderboard build

- **Expected:** Rows ordered by configured stat. Player-web `/stats` shows the leaderboard.

### TC-L3-01 · Game events ingestion (super_admin)
- **Steps:** `/game-events` → record a goal/assist/penalty → save.
- **Expected:** `game_events` row inserted. `project()` rolls into `stat_lines`.

> deferred until real Stripe (P4-1).

### TC-M1-01 · Captain — empty store

### TC-M2-01 · Player browse
- **Role:** player on Team-1
- **Steps:** player-web `/store`.
- **Expected:** Active products grid. Each card shows image, name, price (Intl formatted), variant, description. Out-of-stock badge when `stockQty <= 0`. "Checkout soon" pill (no purchase yet).

### TC-M2-02 · Player on no roster
- **Role:** noroles
- **Steps:** Visit `/store`.
- **Expected:** Empty-state "Not on a roster yet".

### TC-M2-03 · Player — access another team's store
- **Steps:** Player on Team-1 calls `GET /team-store/<team2>/products`.
- **Expected:** 403 "Not a member of this team" (or 404 to avoid leak).

### TC-M2-04 · Super-admin browse any store
- **Role:** super_admin
- **Steps:** Same as M2-03.
- **Expected:** 200. Super-admin bypass works for the captain-or-member gate.

# N. Cron + background jobs

### TC-N1-01 · pg_cron schedule visible
- **Steps:** SQL: `SELECT jobname, schedule, command FROM cron.job ORDER BY jobid;`.
- **Expected:** Sees the migration-0034 jobs (retry-failed, MV refresh) + migration-0036 compliance-lock-sweep.

### TC-N2-01 · Notifications retry-failed
- **See TC-I6-01.**

### TC-N3-01 · MV refresh — `v_active_season_membership`
- **Steps:** Trigger refresh (cron tick or manual `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY`).
- **Expected:** No `prevented other concurrent operations` errors. Stale-read scenarios bounded by tick interval.

### TC-N4-01 · CronSecretGuard rejects missing header
- **Steps:** POST `/communications/cron/retry-failed` without `X-Cron-Secret`.
- **Expected:** 401. Same for materialised-view refresh + compliance sweep.

### TC-N4-02 · CronSecretGuard accepts correct secret
- **Steps:** POST same with `X-Cron-Secret: <CRON_SECRET>`.
- **Expected:** 200.

# O. i18n

> **NEW** (Backlog #13 — landing-web only for now).

### TC-O1-01 · Default locale = English
- **Steps:** Open landing in a new private window (no cookie).
- **Expected:** Hero renders English from `messages/en.json`. `<html lang="en">`.

### TC-O1-02 · Locale switcher present
- **Steps:** Inspect nav.
- **Expected:** `<LocaleSwitcher>` shows current + the other locales (currently `English`, `Español`).

### TC-O1-03 · Switching locale persists
- **Steps:** Pick Español → page reloads.
- **Expected:** `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie set (1 year). Hero copy now in Spanish. Reload again → still Spanish. New private window → back to default.

### TC-O1-04 · Missing key fallback
- **Pre-conditions:** Drop a key from `es.json`.
- **Steps:** Switch to Spanish.
- **Expected:** Next-intl falls back gracefully (logs warning, renders key as fallback). No crash.

### TC-O2-01 · Add a third locale (decision pending — EN-AR-HI)
- **Steps:** Drop `messages/ar.json` + `messages/hi.json` mirroring en.json. Add codes to `LOCALES` in `src/i18n/config.ts`.
- **Expected:** Switcher auto-includes them. Arabic also flips `<html dir="rtl">` (must add to RootLayout).

### TC-O2-02 · RTL audit when Arabic ships
- **Steps:** With `ar` locale active, walk every landing page.
- **Expected:** Sections mirror correctly. No clipping. Icons that imply direction (arrows) flip.

# P. Cross-cutting non-functional

### TC-P1-01 · Scope leak — 404 on out-of-scope
- **Steps:** For every `GET /:resource/:id` and `POST /:resource/:id/...`, request a resource the caller has no scope on.
- **Expected:** 404, never 403, never 200. (CLAUDE.md no-leak rule.) Applies to: orgs, leagues, seasons, divisions, teams, invoices, registrations, refund-assessments, push-subscriptions, etc.

### TC-P2-01 · Audit interceptor records everything
- **Steps:** Perform any 2xx POST/PATCH/DELETE.
- **Expected:** Exactly one audit row, even when the handler emits other side-effects. Action label follows `<resource>.<verb>` convention.

### TC-P3-01 · Idempotency — notifications.queue
- **Steps:** Queue the same notification twice with the same idempotency key (e.g. retry).
- **Expected:** Second call returns the same row, doesn't insert a duplicate.

### TC-P3-02 · Idempotency — broadcast
- **Steps:** Send the same broadcast body twice in a row (same broadcastId not changed by tooling).
- **Expected:** Per-recipient row insert is unique. Re-runs are safe.

### TC-P4-01 · Concurrency — roster cap-1 race
- **Pre-conditions:** Roster at cap-1.
- **Steps:** Two captains (or super-admin sessions) POST add at the same time.
- **Expected:** Exactly one 200, one 409. `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` serialises. No 13th player snuck in.

### TC-P4-02 · Concurrency — guest cap per game
- **Same pattern for the per-game guest cap.**

### TC-P5-01 · Auth — JWT verification rejects garbage
- **Steps:** Hit any guarded endpoint with `Authorization: Bearer garbage`.
- **Expected:** 401.

### TC-P5-02 · Auth — JWT verification rejects expired
- **Steps:** Same with an expired JWT.
- **Expected:** 401.

### TC-P5-03 · Auth — service-role bypass NOT exposed
- **Steps:** Try to coerce a frontend to send the service-role key as a bearer.
- **Expected:** Backend never accepts it as a user JWT. Service-role usage stays server-side only (`apps/superadmin-api`).

### TC-P6-01 · Audit log idempotent under retry
- **Steps:** Force a retry on a transient failure (e.g. provider 503 during email send).
- **Expected:** Audit doesn't double-write. Notification status flips `failed → sent` on success without a second `<resource>.<verb>` row.

### TC-P7-01 · Drizzle types match runtime
- **Steps:** After any schema change, `pnpm --filter @sportspulse/db build` must succeed.
- **Expected:** No `tier: number` vs `tier: string` style drift between TS types and SQL columns.

### TC-P8-01 · Next.js stale type cache
- **Steps:** After deleting / renaming an app route, do a fresh dev server start.
- **Expected:** No "validator.ts references deleted route" errors. (Fix: `rm -rf .next/types`.)

# Q. Cross-app verification matrix

> Use this when you only have time for a smoke pass. Each row is a
> single happy-path that touches multiple apps. Failing any row is a
> blocker.

| # | Setup (who does what) | Verify (where + as whom) |
|---|---|---|
| **Q-01** | super-admin creates org + first league + season | org-admin signs in → sees the new org in switcher, leagues list, season list |
| **Q-02** | org-admin creates league (NEW) | super-admin `/leagues` lists it; audit log row |
| **Q-03** | org-admin creates season + division + team (NEW) | each list page on org-admin reflects; super-admin sees them too |
| **Q-04** | org-admin assigns captain to a team (NEW) | that user signs in to team-admin and lands on captain mode |
| **Q-05** | captain registers team for a season | super-admin `/division-applications` shows pending entry; org-admin sees it under `/registrations` (if surfaced) |
| **Q-06** | captain invites a player by email | invited user receives email; clicks token URL; lands on funnel pre-filled with team |
| **Q-07** | anonymous player submits public funnel | super-admin AND org-admin review queues both show the new row in the right filter |
| **Q-08** | org-admin approves a registration (NEW) | player-web shows the registration card flipped to Approved |
| **Q-09** | minor user submits → parent consents | original player-web shows progress past `pending_consent` |
| **Q-10** | captain drops a paid player | org-admin `/disputes` shows new pending refund_assessment |
| **Q-11** | org-admin adjudicates refund (refund decision) (NEW) | refund_assessments row status flips; super-admin `/finance/refunds` shows the actual disbursement once issued |
| **Q-12** | org-admin records offline payment (NEW) | captain `/captain/dues` reflects the new balance |
| **Q-13** | org-admin sends broadcast to captains (NEW) | captain's `/notifications` shows the in-app row (or email arrives) |
| **Q-14** | captain creates merch product (NEW) | player-web `/store` lists it |
| **Q-15** | captain edits lineup → game starts | lineup locks; player-web `/schedule` shows correct game state |
| **Q-16** | super-admin finalizes a game | standings update on player-web `/team`; stat lines aggregate on `/stats` |
| **Q-17** | captain registers a push subscription (NEW) | API `GET /communications/push` lists it; opt-out toggle from preferences works |
